# Simple-Weekly-Python-Challenges


This is a collection of weekly challenges hosted by [Data in Motion](https://www.linkedin.com/company/data-in-motion-llc/). I really enjoy doing these challenges. IT gives me the opportunity to brush up on basic python skills. They cover different datatypes and functions each week. This files gives a little insight into my coding style. I would call them little snippets.
